// An issue that is not handled is the order in which the holes are removed. Consider the case of a square with 5 holes; 4 near the corners and one in the center (something like the side of a die with a 5). If you try to remove the center hole first then you won't be able to because there is no way to access the outside shape without intersecting other holes. First one of the corner holes has to be removed and only then can the center hole be removed.
// It might be better to not remove holes, but just to do a subract operation on the shape, because some simplification algorithms might produce shapes that intersect with holes, which means that the shape is not contained inside any other shape so these shapes are ignored by this algorithm.
// Using the smallest cut possible produces better result and doesn't lead to glitchy cuts as often. So it is better to set useTheFirstCutFound = false, but this does slow down the algorithm quite a bit.
