Clone the official raylib repository.
Run cmake -B build.
Build some example project.
There might be errors, but the raylib.lib file should be somewhere.
Add the raylib.lib and other libraries that the example project has included in linker settings to the additional libraries to the project.
The version of raylib should match the version of the additional libraries like raygui.
